## General Information
- A regularized regression model to predict housing prices
- The data used is present within the repo

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Ridge regression has provided a better model than lasso despite choosing an optimal alpha for both ridge and lasso.
- This implies that, while the effect is relatively minute, more variables are needed in order to accurately predict house prices.
